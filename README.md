# Al Ain Agent Application

## Overview

The Al Ain Agent Application is a tablet-based solution designed to assist sales agents working at the Al Ain Beverage Factory. This application streamlines the process of creating orders for store owners and shopkeepers. Agents can view store details, browse available products, specify quantities and prices, and generate professional PDF order summaries. Additionally, the app allows agents to log visits to stores where no orders were placed, providing a comprehensive daily activity report in PDF format.

This project is built using React Native for the frontend and Firebase as the backend database, ensuring a seamless and efficient user experience.
